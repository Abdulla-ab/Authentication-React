  Inheritance – Inheritance allows classes to inherit common properties from the parent class. For an example in a football team all, the players have same parent properties like dress code. With that, we can have different players with different playing strategical methods.

  Encapsulation – It means it binds data and code together into one unit. For an example, encapsulation is a large organization. That organization is consists of several departments like the sales, accounts, production etc. It combines this entire department together and had formed the organization.

  Abstraction – It displays only the important information by hiding the implementation part. For an example the ATM, machine.

Therefore, it hidden the process and showing the getting inputs and giving the output. 


2. What is the SDLC model and explain the various segments of it?

  SDLC is a process that consists of a detailed plan telling that how to develop, maintain etc. It is a methodology to improve the quality of an overall development process. Below are the various segments of it, 
Planning – Here will determine project goals and establish a high-level plan for the intended project. The Feasibility assessment and creation of project plan will happen in this stage.

  Defining Requirements – Here the relevant people gather the product requirements and prepare an SRS document that including of all the product requirements that to be designed and developed during the project life cycle.

  Design – Here describes the desired features and operations of the system. Design the IT infrastructure and designing the system model.

  Development – In this part, all documents from the previous step transfer into the system. Therefore, here happen the development of IT infrastructure, development of database and code.

  Testing – Here test the product quality before deploy it to relevant market. Identify product defects, fixing and retesting until the product reaches it quality standards that defined in the SRS.

  Deployment – In this phase the product is deployed to the clients where those actual users can being interact with the system.

  Maintenance – Here the system will update according to future needs including meet business goals.


3. What is Docker and what is the use of it?

  Docker allows building, testing and deploying software applications quickly. It package the software into containers that have everything that software need to run like libraries, code and runtime. By using Docker can quickly deploy applications into any environment and the code will run.


4. Explain MVC and MVVC architecture with the diagram.

5. What is Data Flow Diagram?

  It illustrates how data is processed by a system in terms of inputs and outputs. Its focus in on the flow of information that where data comes from, where it goes and how it gets stored
